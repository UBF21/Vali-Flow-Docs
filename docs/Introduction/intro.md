# Welcome

Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to explore Vali-Flow. I truly appreciate your curiosity and intention to check it out. This is a project Iâ€™ve put a lot of care into, aiming to provide both myself and C# developers worldwide with more powerful and accessible validation tools.

## What is Vali-Flow?

**Vali-Flow** is a .NET validation library designed to provide clear, expressive, and reusable validations for any type of application. Its design allows you to define validation rules in a fluent and structured way, reducing repetitive code and improving project maintainability.

## Why use Vali-Flow?

- **Easy to use** â€“ Define validations with a fluent and readable syntax.  
- **Cross-cutting validations** â€“ Works with any collection that implements LINQ (`ICollection`, `List`, `HashSet`, databases, etc.).  
- **Extensible** â€“ Easily add custom validations.  
**Highly flexible** â€“ Supports multiple data types (`string`, `numbers`, `collections`, `booleans`, etc.).  
- **Optimized for performance** â€“ Leverages the power of .NET for fast and efficient validations.  

## How does it help developers?

- **Reduces repetitive code** â†’ Instead of writing manual validations throughout your application, centralize the logic into reusable rules.  
- **Improves organization** â†’ The fluent syntax of **Vali-Flow** allows you to define validations in a clear and structured way.  
- **Simplifies maintenance** â†’ If a validation rule changes, you only need to update it in one place.  
- **LINQ-compatible** â†’ Apply validations to databases, in-memory lists, or any .NET collection.  

## Next Steps

Now that you know what **Vali-Flow** is, continue with the [Installation Guide](./installation.md) to start using the library in your project. ðŸš€
