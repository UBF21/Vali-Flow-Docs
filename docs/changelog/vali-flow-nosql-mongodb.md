## [Unreleased]

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-10-06

### Added
- `ValiFlowDiagnostics` Activity tracing wrapped around `Translate(...)`.

### Fixed
- Closure-captured `null` values now translate to the same `{ field: null }` node as a literal `null` (were previously inconsistent).
- `.In(...)` value lists are now capped at 10,000 entries.

---

## [1.0.0] — Initial release

### Added

- `MongoFilterTranslator` — translates Vali-Flow IR nodes into a MongoDB `BsonDocument` filter (depends only on `MongoDB.Bson`, not the full `MongoDB.Driver`)
- `ValiFlowMongoExtensions.ToMongo<T>()` — extension method on `ValiFlow<T>` and on `Expression<Func<T, bool>>`, with an optional `customConverter` hook
- Support for: equality/inequality, comparison (GT/GTE/LT/LTE), Contains/StartsWith/EndsWith (case-insensitive regex, special characters escaped), IN list, null checks, AND/OR/NOT
- XML documentation on all public types and members
